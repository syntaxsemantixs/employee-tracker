# EMPLOYEE-TRACKER
  
  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)


  ## Description:
  The motivation for creating this app was to create a database for the first time in MySQL. This project was meant to keep user data for any company. For my example I made departments followed by roles, yearly salary and deptId to link the departments together. Lastly the employees would be shown in the end. Which all have a role ID. This solves a basic database if you just want to keep track of employees at a company. I learned how to used the MySQL syntax to create the databases. Creating tables and columns though a schema and seeds SQL files.
